### Server Deployment Predictions
Based on localhost performance:
- **Production Server**: Expect 1.5-2.5s (network latency)
- **CDN Performance**: Should maintain sub-2s loading
- **Mobile Performance**: Likely 2-3s on good connections
- **Low-end Devices**: 3-4s maximum

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. **CDN Setup**: Use CDN for GLB files to reduce server load time
2. **Gzip Compression**: Enable for all text assets
3. **HTTP/2**: Ensure server supports HTTP/2 for parallel requests
4. **Preload Headers**: Add server-side preload headers for critical assets

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user load times
2. **Performance Budgets**: Set alerts if load time exceeds 2.5s
3. **Device Testing**: Test on various mobile devices
4. **Connection Testing**: Verify performance on 3G/4G

### Potential Optimizations
1. **Character LOD**: Consider distance-based level of detail
2. **Texture Streaming**: Progressive texture loading for very large scenes
3. **Animation Culling**: Pause animations when not visible
4. **Memory Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce garbage collection
